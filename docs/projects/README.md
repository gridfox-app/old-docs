# Projects

## What are Projects?
Projects are where you manage data and screens for a single application; where each project has its  own rules for  and group permission settings.

::: tip
You can access your projects at any time by going to the home screen, which you can access by clicking on the Gridfox icon. 
:::


## Creating a New Project
Create a new project by clicking the **New Project** button in the top right of the home screen, then entering a name for your project.

Once created you can rename or delete projects from the home screen using these icons:

![RenameDelete](../Images/RenameDelete.png)

## My Projects vs. Invited Projects
In Gridfox you can either create your own projects or be invited to projects built by someone else.  All of your projects will be displayed on the project homepage.  You can leave a project at any time by clicking the leave project button on the homepage.

##  Edit Mode vs. Runtime Mode
If you have created a project or are assigned a project admin role, you will have the ability to toggle the project between edit mode and runtime by clicking the **Edit Project** and **Close Editor** buttons.
