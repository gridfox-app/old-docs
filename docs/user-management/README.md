# Users & Groups

## Managing Groups

With groups you can provide different levels of access to your system to different users.

### What are Project Admins?

Every project starts with a **Project Admins** group, which is the group with the power to edit your projects and manage users.  The group contains the user who created the project, and any new users added.  The **Project Admins** group cannot be configured, renamed or removed.

### Creating New Groups

To create a new group, in project editor mode:

- Click the Users tab
- Click Groups in the left navigation bar
- Click the Add Group button in the top right

By clicking the configure button you can specify user permissions for each table.

Each flag provides users with different levels of access.
